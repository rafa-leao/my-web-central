# my_web_central

The idea is make a web central to receive useful data, as weather forecast, what time my bus will be in the bus stop and news.

At first, it might be useful just for me.

## How do I run it?

This project use Flask to render the view, and for now, that's all.

So set it up is pretty simple:
- Clone this repository;
- Create a [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and activate it;
- Install the requirements ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
- Run the file ```app.py```

This simple app should be running!
