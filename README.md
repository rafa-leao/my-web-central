# my_web_central

This app shows me: weather forecast, the time my bus will be in the stop and trending news.

The bus data is useful just for me! This data is provided by the [Brazilian transit company](http://www.sptrans.com.br/desenvolvedores/). 

It's really a personal app!

## APIs I used for this project

- [Weather API](http://apiadvisor.climatempo.com.br/doc) from a Brazillian company;
- [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/docs/);
- Bus traffic info from a [Brazilian transit company](http://www.sptrans.com.br/desenvolvedores/api-do-olho-vivo-guia-de-referencia/). 

## How do I run it? (Not deployed yet)

*Made with [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)*

Set it up is pretty simple:
- Clone this repository;
- Create a [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and activate it;
- Install the requirements ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run the file ```app.py```

This simple app should be running!
